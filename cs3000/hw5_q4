modified dijstra: pick max weght first to construct a path
return min from path


 function Dijkstra(Graph, source, target)
        // Initialize  to all nodes as 0: map
        // except source to max 
        bandwith <- node bandwith map
 
        // Initialize an empty set of visited nodes 
        visited <- empty set

        // start with source
        visited.add   source 

        //Relaxation: relax its neightbor by
        for each edge e(s, n)
             min <- bandwith[s], w(e)
             if  bandwith[n] < min  
                    bandwith[n] <- min

   // Loop until all nodes have been visited.
   while target not visited :
       choose v from bandwidth that is not visited, and has max value
       relax all its edges
       add v to visited
    // now found path from visited: source, v1, v2 ..... target
     result <- look up bandwith map, find the minimum value of all nodes: v1 .... target
   return  result



c: modified dijstar, take from it ..
